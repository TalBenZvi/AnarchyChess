# Anarchy Chess

## A Real-time, Team Based Chess Game

Anarchy Chess is a game that brings the classical game of chess into the MOBA genre (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena).
The game is played in teams of 16 vs 16 players as each player only controls one piece.
Focus on playing your assigned role and cooperate with your allies in order to take down the enemy king while defending your own.

- No turns, instead each player has their own cooldown for playing moves. Move your piece according to your turn timer while every other piece moves according to its own, _simultaneously_

- A piece that died (was captured) will respawn on its original square after a death timer. The graveyard will display the remaining timers for all dead pieces

- A piece's turn cooldown and respawn timer are longer the stronger the piece is (a pawn is faster than a queen) so no piece should feel stronger than another

- Play with all the existing mechanics including castling, promotion and en-passant and experience their special properties in the real-time environment

- No checks, mates or stalemates. In order to win just capture the enemy king (it's already difficult enough since this is the fastest piece)

- After a round ends a new one will begin shortly where you'll be randomly assigned a different piece. Compete to see which team can score the most points or just play for fun

- A lobby is meant for 32 player overall but if you're struggling to find traction you can fill the rest of the spots with bots
